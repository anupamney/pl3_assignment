              <p>Developing a Software Tool to aid Search and Rescue by Calculating and Plotting Search Area from the Last Known Position of a Missing Aircraft.</p>         
              <p>Search and Rescue (SAR) is an operation to find and rescue the people in distress. SAR operations aim at finding missing objects with minimum time in a determined area. There are fundamentally two problems in these operations. The first problem is assessing highly reliable probability distribution maps, and the second is determining the search pattern that sweeps the area from the air as fast as possible. SAR operations benefit greatly from the GIS technology. The area, determined by the search planner, that is to be searched is called Search Area. This area may be sub-divided into search sub-areas for the purpose of assigning specific responsibilities to the available search facilities. The International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR) Vol. II (ICAO DOC 9731) provides all necessary information and guidance. Projecs intends to achive: • Determining the size of the search area from the Last Known Position (LKP), including speed, heading and attitude, of aircraft. • Determining the desired area coverage • Selecting appropriate search patterns.</p>
