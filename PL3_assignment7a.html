            We all know that fish is high in protein and low in fat. But it’s also loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, which help maintain heart health by lowering blood pressure. Omegas 3’s also are known to be beneficial to healthy brain function and development. In fact, the American Heart Association recommends eating two servings of fish per week as part of a heart-healthy diet. But, that’s not all this healthy alternative to ground beef has to offer. It’s also rich in phosphorus and calcium, and is an excellent source of minerals, including iron, zinc, iodine, magnesium, and potassium.

            So, is the argument over? Fish is good for you, and it might be wise to replace the burgers and dogs now and then with some great-tasting fillets. Your heart will thank you later. And, one thing that makes it better – is the grill. The direct, high-heat cooks it quickly and locks in the flavor without removing much moisture. The end result can be quite magnificent.

            Here are some quick tips on how to properly cook your fish on the grill.
            Marinate. All fish taste better with a flavorful marinade. Just place it with some oil, herbs, or spices in a bag and place in the refrigerator for about 15 to 20 minutes.
            Brush the grill with oil. The last thing you want is your fish sticking to your cooking surface and falling apart. So not only should you brush it with oil – unless your marinade includes oil – you should also brush the grates. Then once it’s on the grill, let it sear for at least two to three minutes before flipping. If you flip too soon, if can stick and tear apart.
            Make sure your grill is very hot. If you put it on a warm grill, you will get bad results (i.e. sticking and falling apart). If the grill is screaming hot, the fish will sear immediately.
            Don’t grill for too long. It will cook in a matter of minutes. So don’t put your fish on the grill and then go talk to your neighbor… or else you’ll definitely be ordering take out.
